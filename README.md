# AMS-CDT-first-year-report
This repository is the code and output simulations from my first year report

Preprocessing
For the MTEX analysis, you must run them in order:

1: ags1.m 

2: Pats_Pole_Plot.m 

3: rot_by_axis_angle.m

For python analysis
The main file with a lot of the analysis is Extrusion-analysis.ipynb
Stress strain curve.ipynb was created to plot different data sets on the same plot, the data sets were monotonic loading stress strain curves and the mean slip bar charts
mesh convergence.ipynb was as created to plot different data sets on the same plot, thee data sets where the resulation simulations
